# SQL-code
My past work in Microsoft SQL Server and Postgre environments.

* The Basics.sql file contains function like CREATE TABLE, INSER INTO+VALUES, SELECT+FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY+ORDER BY statements.

* In Intermediate.sql file, I played with functions like INNER/OUTER JOIN, UNION operator, CASE statement, HAVING clause, UPDATING/DELETING, ALIASING, and PARTITION BY

* In Advanced.sql file, I played with Common Table Expression (CTE), Temp tables, String functions, Stored procedures, and Subqueries.
